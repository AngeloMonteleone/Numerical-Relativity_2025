# Numerical-Relativity_2025
Repository for the 2024-25 course in Numerical Relativity. The repository is organized as follows
## Homework 1

## Homework 2
There are two repositories, one for the first excercise (the SOD shock tube) and one for the second (the simulation of a stable TOV solution)
### SOD
The repository contains the parameter file used for the simulation and some plots. The images containing the word "subplot" consist of three plots, one for the initial state, one for an intermediate state at half the simulated time and one at the final instant of the simulation (compared also with the exact solution)
- "SOD_subplots" for the evolution of the density
- "SOD_subplots_vel" for the evolution of the velocity
- "SOD_subplots_press" for the evolution of the pressure
### TOV
I chose the second option, introducing a perturbation in pressure and evolving the system with three different resolutions. For comparison I also performed just one unperturbed simulation. There are two repositories:
- "unperturbed simulation" for the files concerning the one unperturbed simulation 
- "perturbed simulations" for the files concerning the three simulations with the pressure perturbation

The names "TOV20","TOV15","TOV10" refer, respectively, to the simulations with spacings 2.0,1.5,1.0. There are GIF's of the whole evolutions and also the plots for the evolutions maximum of the rest mass density.
